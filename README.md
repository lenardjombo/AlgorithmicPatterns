## About

This repository contains a series of exercises in the form of code implementations that generate various patterns such as triangles, pyramids, diamonds, and other creative shapes. By solving these problems, you'll develop a deeper understanding of core algorithmic concepts such as loops, recursion and nested structures, all while writing clean, efficient code.

### Key Goals:
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Practice programming and algorithm implementation
- Understand how different types of loops and control flow can be combined to create complex patterns
- Develop the ability to craft custom algorithms for specific challenges

### Getting Started

To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine:

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lenardjombo/AlgorithmicPatterns.git
```

**Prerequisites**
To run the code, ensure that you have set up any programming tool/language on your machine e.g Go

You can download and install Go from this link [Download](https://go.dev/doc/install)

**Installation**

1.Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lenardjombo/AlgorithmicPatterns.git
```
2.Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
    cd AlgorithmicPatterns
```
3.Compile and run any Go program inside the repository
```bash
    go run <filename>.go
```
### Usage
Each pattern is implemented in separate Go files. **For example**:
- **[Pyramid]()** - `pyramid.go` - Generates a pyramid pattern.

### Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions that can improve the algorithmic patterns, add new ones, or optimize existing code. Please ensure your code follows best practices and is well-commented.

**Steps to Contribute:**
- 1.Fork the repository
- 2.Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch)
- 3.Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new pattern')
- 4.Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch)
- 5.Open a pull request

This project is licensed under the MIT License â€“ see the LICENSE file for details.

You can explore each Go file to study how the algorithms are structured, understand the loop logic, and modify them to create your own variations of the patterns.
```bash
    
You can copy and paste this into your `README.md` file, and it should work perfectly! Let me know if you need further adjustments.
